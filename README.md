# Elementary Cellular Automata

I have played a bit with Cellular Automata, after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-fVdbjAwk) by @mpj.
Code is written in a functional way, with React for displaying the cells. You can use the automata matrix function without the React part as well.

Just change the `rule` constant in `src/index.js` and see all sorts of different patterns emerging.
Start the development server with `npm start`. Enjoy!
